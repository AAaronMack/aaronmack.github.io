I have always been interested in computers and programming, and I am very fond of the scenes in animated films; I am not satisfied and only stay in my imagination. I dream of making them like them. After I first came into contact with 3D software in 2016, I was out of control. I have been self-taught during this period. I like to give myself difficult problems, constantly challenge and break through myself. In 2017, I signed up for an online course to learn modeling and rendering. Later, I learned Houdini special effects and programming by myself, and I have embarked on a journey since then.

Like to **learn new knowledge**, like to **share**, like to **communicate**, like graphics and AI, Like programs, like brain holes.
